# ALL RIGHTS GO TO DEV.TO 
I just followed along and plan to work on a front facing site for it. to add a new block and revalidate the chain, and mine mint new js tokens. 
I am no means taking credit. the code was all done by [freakcdev297](https://github.com/nguyenphuminh/JeChain/blob/main/jechain.js)

**I am just posting to my github for future work to get add more functionality to the data IE: Smart contracts :)**

Please go visit his git hub for more details on the way he did the code. [DEV.TO Creating A blockchain in 60 lines of JS](https://dev.to/freakcdev297/creating-a-blockchain-in-60-lines-of-javascript-5fka)

----------

I am looking for this as demonstration purposes on creating an ERC based Tuner Token
If you support the Tuner Movement and want to help please contact me. again I do not take credit for the code here. 
I am however updating it to work for more functionality and have a more front facing demontration of the blocks and adding new blocks and displaying in the browser. 
I will potetnionally try to try this to metamask and WAX :)
